## üîí Security Considerations

### Production Deployment
1. **Test thoroughly** in non-production environments
2. **Create system restore points** before execution
3. **Configure proper certificates** for PowerShell Remoting
4. **Customize remote host credentials** securely
5. **Review firewall rules** for application compatibility
6. **Monitor logs regularly** for security events

### Emergency Procedures

- Critical services are preserved during emergency mode
- All actions are logged for forensic analysis
- System requires manual intervention to restore after emergency

## üéØ Best Practices

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor self-healing agent logs daily
- Review honeytoken access logs weekly
- Update Windows and security definitions regularly
- Test emergency procedures quarterly
- Validate remote mirroring functionality monthly

### Customization
- Add organization-specific honeytokens
- Configure custom sound files for alerts
- Implement additional monitoring scripts
- Customize remote mirroring destinations
- Add organization-specific hardening rules

## üìû Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **PowerShell 7.5+ Not Found**: Install latest PowerShell from Microsoft
2. **Access Denied**: Ensure running as Administrator
3. **Remote Mirroring Fails**: Configure WinRM and certificates properly
4. **Sound Files Not Playing**: Check file paths and permissions
5. **Services Won't Stop**: Check service dependencies

### Logging and Diagnostics
All operations are logged with timestamps and detailed error information. Use `-LogLevel DEBUG` for maximum verbosity during troubleshooting.

### Emergency Recovery
If the system becomes unresponsive:
1. Reboot the system
2. Disable BND scheduled tasks: `Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName "BND_*"`
3. Re-enable required services manually
4. Review logs for root cause analysis
